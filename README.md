I started this assignment on my own. Next, I worked with my Northwestern Coding Bootcamp Tutor on this assignment for 1 hour. My tutor agreed with my initial plan but had some changes and suggestions in terms of HTML structure. After continuing to work on this project with some progress, I started referencing a previous project I found on GitHub.
