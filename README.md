# day-planner-hw

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This project assigned through Northwestern University's Coding Bootcamp was to make a simple day planner where a user can add and save items to their calendar for the day. Saved inputs should remain on the screen even after the page is refreshed. The color of the rows should also change automatically based on the time of day so the user is aware of the flow of their day. We have been instructed to use jquery and moment.js, so both of those will be used in this project.

Some HTML and CSS were provided for this assignement.


SOURCES

I started this assignment on my own. Next, I worked with my Northwestern Coding Bootcamp Tutor on this assignment for 1 hour. My tutor agreed with my initial plan but had some changes and suggestions in terms of HTML structure. After continuing to work on this project with some progress, I started referencing a previous project presumably from another student, on Github.

I spent a long time reviewing several different projects, but ultimately felt this one was the most similar to the structure I had already setup and was trying to accomplish. I then studied to understand each of the concept and tactics being used in this project, and attempted to implement them with mine. I made sure I was reviewing anything I wasn't 100% understanding on the first pass so that I was aware of everything my code was doing. This project also used the "this" concept which I was actually excited about using in a real project so I could learn the application better.

Even with another project to reference, this task was still a struggle for me. Project Link: https://github.com/sguitjens/homework5
