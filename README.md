I started this assignment on my own. Next, I worked with my Northwestern Coding Bootcamp Tutor on this assignment for 1 hour. My tutor agreed with my initial plan but had some changes and suggestions in terms of HTML structure. After continuing to work on this project with some progress, I started referencing a previous project presumably from another student, on Github.

I spent a long time reviewing several different projects, but ultimately felt this one was the most similar to the structure I had already setup and was trying to accomplish. I then studied to understand each of the concept and tactics being used in this project, and attempted to implement them with mine. I made sure I was reviewing anything I wasn't 100% understanding on the first pass so that I was aware of everything my code was doing. This project also used the "this" concept which I was actually excited about using in a real project so I could learn the application better.

Even with another project to reference, this task was still a struggle for me. Project Link: https://github.com/sguitjens/homework5
